# Friend Request System Implementation

## Overview
A complete Facebook-like friend request system has been implemented for the Royal Media social network application. Users can now send friend requests, accept/reject them, manage friendships, and message their friends.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Database Models

#### FriendRequest Model (`apps/auth/src/models/FriendRequest.ts`)
- Tracks friend requests between users
- Status: pending, accepted, rejected, cancelled
- Includes optional message field
- Automatic timestamp tracking

#### Friendship Model (`apps/auth/src/models/Friendship.ts`)
- Tracks accepted friendships
- Ensures no duplicate friendships
- Optimized for friend lookups

### 2. Friend Service (`apps/auth/src/services/FriendService.ts`)
- `sendFriendRequest()` - Send friend requests with validation
- `acceptFriendRequest()` - Accept pending requests
- `rejectFriendRequest()` - Reject pending requests
- `cancelFriendRequest()` - Cancel sent requests
- `removeFriend()` - Remove existing friendships
- `getFriends()` - Get user's friends list
- `searchUsers()` - Search for users to add as friends
- `getFriendshipStatus()` - Check relationship status between users

### 3. Friend Controller (`apps/auth/src/controllers/FriendController.ts`)
- RESTful API endpoints for all friend operations
- Proper error handling and validation
- Authentication required for all endpoints

### 4. API Routes (`apps/auth/src/routes/friends.ts`)
```
POST   /api/friends/requests           - Send friend request
PATCH  /api/friends/requests/:id/accept - Accept friend request
PATCH  /api/friends/requests/:id/reject - Reject friend request
PATCH  /api/friends/requests/:id/cancel - Cancel friend request
DELETE /api/friends/friends/:id         - Remove friend
GET    /api/friends/friends             - Get friends list
GET    /api/friends/requests/received   - Get received requests
GET    /api/friends/requests/sent       - Get sent requests
GET    /api/friends/status/:userId      - Get friendship status
GET    /api/friends/search              - Search users
```

- `UserSearch` - Complete search interface with debounced input

#### Base UI Components

- Proper TypeScript interfaces and styling

### 2. Hooks (`packages/ui/src/hooks/`)

#### useFriends Hook (`use-friends.ts`)
- Complete state management for friends functionality
- API integration with proper error handling
